The VL6180x by ST micro is a time of flight range finder that
uses pulsed IR light to determine distances from object at close
range.  The average range of a sensor is between 0-200mm

In this file are the function prototypes in the VL6180x class

Resources:
This library uses the Arduino Wire.h to complete I2C transactions.

Development environment specifics:
	IDE: Arduino 1.0.5
	Hardware Platform: Arduino Pro 3.3V/8MHz
	VL6180x Breakout Version: 1.0


This code is beerware. If you see me (or any other SparkFun employee) at the
local pub, and you've found our code helpful, please buy us a round!
